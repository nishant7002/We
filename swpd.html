    <h2><u>About Electronic Waste:</u></h2>
    <p>
      E-waste or electronic waste is created when an electronic product is discarded after the end of its useful life. The rapid expansion of technology and the consumption driven society results in the creation of a very large amount of e-waste.

      In the US, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classifies e-waste into ten categories:
      
      Large household appliances, including cooling and freezing appliances
      Small household appliances
      IT equipment, including monitors
      Consumer electronics, including televisions
      Lamps and luminaires

    <h2><u>The Dumping Process:</u></h2>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, electronic waste is often improperly disposed of, leading to serious environmental consequences. Dumping e-waste in landfills or incinerating it can release toxic substances into the air, water, and soil, contaminating ecosystems and endangering human populations.
    </p>

    <h2>
      
      <u>Importance of Responsible E-Waste Disposal:</u></h2>
    <p>
      It is crucial to promote responsible e-waste disposal to minimize the environmental and health risks associated with electronic waste. Recycling e-waste helps recover valuable resources and reduces the demand for new materials. Additionally, it ensures that hazardous substances are safely handled and disposed of, protecting the environment and human well-being.
